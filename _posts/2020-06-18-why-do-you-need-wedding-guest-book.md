After attending a lot of weddings in my life, I realized that there is something much more meaningful for the couple than 
just receiving gifts. Chances are that the couple will forget, sooner rather than later, what they received from whom. 
Especially if it was a large ceremony. However, words are everlasting and the best wishes from those close to them will 
resound throughout their lifeâ€™s.

When that sacred day draws to a conclusion, the beautiful memories will linger on throughout. This is why I am of the 
belief that a Wedding Guest Book is an integral part of this Ceremony. Here are 2 additional reasons why you should 
consider having a Guest Book on the most important day of your life!

### 2 Reasons Why You Should Purchase A Wedding Guest Book

#### 1. It captures memories of your wedding that you can always go back to.
Can you imagine how wonderful it would be to open this book up on your 10th anniversary, or even your 25th, just to reminisce? 
The memories that would bring back!

#### 2. It is much more than just a guest book.
Guest books don't have to consist of just sign-in pages. They can include many useful features like pocket for cards and letters or pages for
keeping track of cash, gifts, and thank you notes, or even Family Tree pages.

### White Dove Publications
If you are considering purchasing a Wedding Guest Book, then I would strongly recommend you to check out this [astonishing 
Wedding Guest Book Set offered by White Dove Publications](https://www.amazon.com/White-Dove-Publications-Hardcover-Signature/dp/B082LVL47N/ref=sr_1_75?crid=8L054ZCGN7E9&keywords=wedding+guest+book&qid=1580904677&sprefix=wedding+guest%2Caps%2C243&sr=8-75).

Not only does the book look elegant but it also comes with a premium pen and a table sign. The ink is rich, deep black that 
wonâ€™t ever bleed through the pages. The pen feels good in your hand and stores conveniently in the box it will arrive in. 
The card stands up, allowing guests to locate this book during Your wedding event. The set is packaged in a lovely gold embossed box.
