If I had to put it in a few words I'd say **this wedding sign in book is astonishing!** Not only does it look elegant but it also comes with a premium pen and a table sign. The ink is rich, deep black that wonâ€™t ever bleed through the pages. The pen feels good in your hand and stores conveniently in the box it will arrive in. The card stands up, allowing guests to locate this book during Your wedding event.

The product arrived at my house in under 2 days (due to Amazon Prime shipping within the US) packaged in a lovely gold embossed box. I was very pleased with the product!

## #2 Custom Gold Foil Wedding Guest Book

This wedding guest book looks simple yet beautiful, and it's a great alternative to its predecessor as it's personalised. Details like names, dates, and more can be featured on the book's cover and even within the pages!

I really like the idea of featuring names on a guest book's cover as it adds more personal touch to it.

Last but not least, you might be interested in this non-traditional, personalized wooden wedding guest book. The book's cover looks creative and features a big heart and your names right below it. There's different color variations available for the heart (red, pink, golden, silver and white).

However, this seller is based in the UK, so you might have to pay an extra fee for the delivery to the US.
