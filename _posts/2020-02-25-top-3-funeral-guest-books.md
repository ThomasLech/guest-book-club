Losing someone you love can be one of the darkest seasons in your life. I believe that is why funeral ceremonies have been part of the human experience from time immemorial. 
In today’s fast-paced, digital world, it is nice to sometimes slow down and reflect on the lives of those that have most recently passed. 
Coming together is one way to celebrate that loved one. Having a space to jot down a simple signature, or a brief loving memory is a wonderful way to collect and remember 
the love that was shown to that loved one during their memorial event. These memories can be kept in a funeral guest book.

To save you time and money we decided to create this compilation of top 3 Funeral Guest Books that you can purchase online.

This is **the best Funeral Guest Book I've found on the internet!** Not only does it look elegant but it also comes with a premium pen and a table sign. The ink is rich, deep black that won’t ever bleed through the pages. The pen feels good in your hand and stores conveniently in the box it will arrive in. The card stands up, allowing guests to locate this book during funeral event.

The product arrived at my house in under 2 days (due to Amazon Prime shipping within the US) packaged in a lovely gold embossed box. I was greatly pleased with the product!

## #2 PurpleTrail Personalized Funeral Guest Book

This Funeral Guest Book looks simple yet beautiful, and it's a great alternative to the first guest book featured on our list as it's personalised. The book cover features the name of Your loved one as well as their photos.

I really like the idea of featuring name and photos of Your loved one on a guest book's cover as it adds more personal touch to it.
